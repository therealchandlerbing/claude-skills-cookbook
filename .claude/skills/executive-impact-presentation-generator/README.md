## Troubleshooting

### HTML Dashboard Issues

**Charts not loading?**

- Open browser console for errors
- Verify JavaScript is enabled

**Looks different on mobile?**
- This is expected (responsive design)
- Test on actual device, not just browser resize
- Print view auto-expands all sections

**Print layout issues?**
- Use Chrome for best print results
- Set to "Print backgrounds" in print dialog
- Choose portrait or landscape based on content

### PowerPoint Outline Issues

**Formatting lost when pasting?**
- Use "Keep Text Only" paste option
- Manually apply formatting in PowerPoint
- Refer to visual descriptions for layout

**Scripts too long/short?**
- Edit to match your speaking pace
- Use scripts as guidelines, not verbatim
- Practice timing before presentation

### General Questions

- Yes! Both formats are fully editable
- HTML: Edit with text editor
- PowerPoint: Edit directly in presentation software

- Absolutely! Save as templates
